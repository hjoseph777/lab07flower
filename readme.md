## Flower Shop Application

This program handles flower orders for a small shop. Customers can order different types of annual flowers and the application keeps track of all orders.

## How It Works

1. Run the program from the Tester class
2. Enter flower quantities separated by commas (example: 2,3,1,5)
3. Keep entering orders until you're done
4. Type "exit" when finished
5. The program shows a summary of all orders
